# 🎮 **Hangman Game**

## 📝 **Overview**
Welcome to the **Hangman Game**! This is a console-based game developed in Java. The objective is simple: guess the hidden word one letter at a time. You have a limited number of attempts, so make your guesses wisely! A hint is provided to help you guess the word. Enjoy the challenge and see if you can guess the word before running out of attempts!

## ✨ **Features**
- 🎲 **Random Word Selection**: The game selects a word randomly from a predefined list for each session.
- 💡 **Hint System**: Each word comes with a helpful hint to guide your guesses.
- 🎮 **User Interaction**: Players can guess one letter at a time and see their progress after each guess.
- 🕒 **Limited Attempts**: Players have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.
- 🧩 **Reveal Letter Option**: Players can choose to reveal one letter at the cost of one remaining attempt.
- 🔄 **Play Again**: After each game, players can choose to play again with a new word.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- ☕ **Java**: The programming language used to develop the game.
- 🎤 **Scanner**: Used for capturing user input from the console.

## 🎯 **How to Play**
1. **Start the Game**: When you run the game, a random word is selected, and a hint is provided.
2. **Guess Letters**: Enter one letter at a time to try and guess the word.
3. **Track Progress**: After each guess, you'll see the current state of the word (with correct guesses filled in) and the letters you've guessed so far.
4. **Reveal a Letter**: You can choose to reveal one letter if you're stuck, but it will cost you one of your remaining attempts.
5. **Win or Lose**: If you guess the word before running out of attempts, you win! If not, the correct word is revealed, and you can choose to play again.
